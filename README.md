To create a more comprehensive "ROI Analysis for Digital Workspace Implementations" project that considers factors like time value of money, sensitivity analysis, and addresses other important aspects. We'll use Python and add more sophisticated calculations and visualization techniques. For this example, we'll assume you have data for initial investments, annual cash flows, and a discount rate.
In this improved example, we calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for each project to handle the time value of money. We use a discount rate of 10% as an example, but you should replace it with the actual discount rate used in your analysis.

The NPV calculation discounts each year's cash flow to its present value and then calculates the difference between the present value of inflows and the initial investment. The IRR calculation determines the annual rate of return that makes the NPV of cash flows equal to zero.

The data visualization includes two y-axes: one for NPV (blue bars) and another for IRR (red line with markers). This allows for easy comparison between the two metrics for each project.
